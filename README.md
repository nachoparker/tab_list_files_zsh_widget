# List files without stopping to type in zsh

![example](/resources/zsh_widget-1.gif)

This zsh widget allows you to list files in the current directory without interrupting the command you are typing.
Usage

    Hit <tab> in the middle of any command. It will list all files below the command line.
    Hit <space><tab> on an empty command line. It will list directories.
    Hit <space><space><tab> on an empty command line. It will list executables.

Regular completion is unaffected.
